Shared Dependencies:

1. Exported Variables:
   - `NODE_HOST` (The host address of the Bitcoin node)
   - `NODE_PORT` (The port on which the Bitcoin node is running)
   - `NODE_USER` (The username for RPC access to the Bitcoin node)
   - `NODE_PASS` (The password for RPC access to the Bitcoin node)

2. Data Schemas:
   - None specified, but likely a schema for Bitcoin block and transaction data if the explorer interfaces with the node's RPC API.

3. ID Names of DOM Elements:
   - Not specified, as `3xpl.php` is a PHP file and might not directly interact with the DOM. If there is a front-end component, potential IDs could be:
     - `block_info` (for displaying block information)
     - `transaction_list` (for displaying a list of transactions)
     - `search_input` (for a search bar to find specific blocks or transactions)

4. Message Names:
   - Not specified, but potential message names could include:
     - `NodeConnectionError` (for errors connecting to the Bitcoin node)
     - `SyncStatusUpdate` (for messages related to the sync status of the node)

5. Function Names:
   - `connectToNode` (function to establish a connection to the Bitcoin node)
   - `getSyncStatus` (function to check the sync status of the node)
   - `fetchBlockData` (function to fetch data for a specific block)
   - `fetchTransactionData` (function to fetch data for a specific transaction)

Please note that the actual names of the shared dependencies may vary based on the specific implementation details of the Bitcoin explorer and the node software being used. The names provided here are hypothetical and based on the typical patterns used in such applications.
